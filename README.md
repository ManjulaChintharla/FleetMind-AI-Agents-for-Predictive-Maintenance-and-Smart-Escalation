## **Overview**:

The Fleet Maintenance AI Scenario is an end-to-end solution that predicts vehicle maintenance needs using real-time telemetry data. It combines Azure Data Factory, PostgreSQL, Azure Machine Learning, Azure AI Search, and GPT-powered chat to deliver predictive insights and intelligent suggestions for the logistics and transportation industry.


# Azure End-to-End AI Fleet Maintenance Platform

This project is a complete AI-powered pipeline for predictive vehicle maintenance, tailored for data scientists and MLOps engineers. It demonstrates how to build an end-to-end solutionâ€”from ingesting raw fleet sensor data (IOT) to delivering intelligent maintenance predictions and document-based suggestions via a conversational AI assistant. Built entirely on Microsoft Azure, it combines real-time telemetry, Azure machine learning, Azure vector search, and Azure OpenAI GPT-powered chat to help logistics companies minimize downtime and make data-driven maintenance decisions.

###  Pipeline Overview

- **Azure Data Factory** for data ingestion from multiple sources
- **PostgreSQL** for storing cleaned fleet data
- **Azure Machine Learning** for training and deploying predictive models
- **OpenAI Embeddings + PostgreSQL** for text vectorization
- **Azure AI Search** to enable intelligent search
- **Azure OpenAI** to build a chatbot with document and prediction query capabilities

###  Features

- Predict fleet maintenance using ML models
- Query insights from data and documents using semantic search
- Chatbot interface powered by OpenAI that connects to your backend systems
